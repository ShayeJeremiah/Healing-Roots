# Healing-Roots
Healing Roots is a mobile application designed for Black users ages 18-50 with anxiety disorders to manage symptoms, connect with mental health professionals, and schedule appointments with ease. 
# Purpose
The primary goal of this project is to confront the significant disparity in mental health resources within the Black community. This is done by:
1. Providing crisis management tools at their fingertips
2. Providing affordable and accessible counseling services
3. Streamlining the process of transitioning between healthcare providers, effectively reducing both the time and cost associated with medical visits.
# How It Works
The key features of healing roots include:
1. An Electronic Mental Health Record (EMHR) offers centralized storage of patient information, encompassing medical history, diagnoses, medications, and treatment plans, alongside mental health assessments, therapy notes, triggers, and progress reports. By integrating mental health data into overall treatment plans, healthcare providers can tailor personalized care strategies considering both physical and psychological factors. EMHR facilitates communication and collaboration among primary care physicians, mental health professionals, and other healthcare providers to ensure coordinated care for patients with dual physical and mental health needs. Additionally, it empowers patients to actively engage in their care by granting access to mental health information, self-assessment tools, and educational resources through the EHR patient portal.

2. Sprouty, a crisis AI Helper, is designed to aid individuals experiencing anxiety or panic attacks by guiding them through breathing techniques and meditations, offering various advantages. During moments of crisis, access to human support or providers may be unavailable. Sprouty ensures immediate assistance, delivering guidance precisely when needed. Unlike traditional therapy, which may have limited availability, Sprouty is accessible 24/7 from anywhere with an internet connection, extending support to individuals in remote or isolated locations. Those experiencing anxiety or panic attacks may hesitate to seek help due to fear of judgment. Sprouty provides a non-judgmental environment, where individuals can receive guidance without fear of criticism. Additionally, each person's experience with anxiety differs, and Sprouty can provide personalized guidance tailored to individual needs, enhancing effectiveness and relevance. Moreover, it can seamlessly integrate with Electronic Mental Health Records (EMHR), alerting providers of crises and granting access to AI notes for comprehensive evaluation of health.
